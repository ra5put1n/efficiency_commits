    Ported Ruby extension to upb_msg (#8184)
    
    * WIP.
  
    * Added some missing files.
    
    * Updated upb.
    
    * Extension loads, but crashes immediately.
    
    * Gets through the test suite without SEGV!
    
    Still a lot of bugs to fix, but it is a major step!
    
    214 tests, 378 assertions, 37 failures, 147 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
    14.0187% passed
    
    * Test and build for Ruby 3.0
    
    * Fixed a few more bugs, efficient #inspect is almost done.
    
    214 tests, 134243 assertions, 30 failures, 144 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
    18.6916% passed
    
    * Fixed message hash initialization and encode depth checking.
    
    214 tests, 124651 assertions, 53 failures, 70 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
    42.5234% passed
    
    * A bunch of fixes to failing tests, now 70% passing.
    
    214 tests, 202091 assertions, 41 failures, 23 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
    70.0935% passed
    
    * More than 80% of tests are passing now.
    
    214 tests, 322331 assertions, 30 failures, 9 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
    81.7757% passed
    
    Unfortunately there is also a sporadic bug/segfault hanging around
    that appears to be GC-related.
    
    * Add linux/ruby30 and macos/ruby30
    
    * Use rvm master for 3.0.0-preview2
    
    * Over 90% of tests are passing!
    
    214 tests, 349898 assertions, 15 failures, 1 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
    92.5234% passed
    
    * Passes all tests!
    
    214 tests, 369388 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications
    100% passed
    
    * A bunch of cleanup.
    
    1. Removed a bunch of internal-only symbols from headers.
    2. Required a frozen check to get a non-const pointer to a map or array.
    3. De-duplicated the code to get a type argument for Map/RepeatedField.
    
    * Removed a bunch more stuff from protobuf.h.  There is an intermittent assert failure.
    
    Intermittent failure:
    
    ruby: ../../../../ext/google/protobuf_c/protobuf.c:263: ObjectCache_Add: Assertion `rb_funcall(obj_cache2, (__builtin_constant_p("[]") ? __extension__ ({ static ID rb_intern_id_cache; if (!rb_intern_id_cache) rb_intern_id_cache = rb_intern2((("[]")
    ), (long)strlen(("[]"))); (ID) rb_intern_id_cache; }) : rb_intern("[]")), 1, key_rb) == val' failed
    
    * Removed a few more things from protobuf.h.
    
    * Ruby 3.0.0-preview2 to 3.0.0
    
    * Require rake-compiler-dock >= 1.1.0
    
    * More progress, fighting with the object cache.
    
    * Passes on all Ruby versions!
    
    * Updated and clarified comment regarding WeakMap.
    
    * Fixed the wyhash compile.
    
    * Fixed conformance tests for Ruby.
    
    Conformance results now look like:
    
    RUBYLIB=../ruby/lib:. ./conformance-test-runner --enforce_recommended --failure_list failure_list_ruby.txt --text_format_failure_list text_format_failure_list_ruby.txt ./conformance_ruby.rb
    
    CONFORMANCE TEST BEGIN ====================================
    
    CONFORMANCE SUITE PASSED: 1955 successes, 0 skipped, 58 expected failures, 0 unexpected failures.
    
    CONFORMANCE TEST BEGIN ====================================
    
    CONFORMANCE SUITE PASSED: 0 successes, 111 skipped, 8 expected failures, 0 unexpected failures.
    
    Fixes include:
    
    - Changed Ruby compiler to no longer reject proto2 maps.
    - Changed Ruby compiler to emit a warning when proto2 extensions are
      present instead of rejecting the .proto file completely.
    - Fixed conformance tests to allow proto2 and look up message by name
      instead of hardcoding a specific list of messages.
    - Fixed conformance test to support the "ignore unknown" option for
      JSON.
    - Fixed conformance test to properly report serialization errors.
    
    * Removed debug printf and fixed #inspect for floats.
    
    * Fixed compatibility test to have proper semantics for #to_json.
    
    * Updated Makefile.am with new file list.
    
    * Don't try to copy wyhash when inside Docker.
    
    * Fixed bug where we would forget that a sub-object is frozen in Ruby >=2.7.
    
    * Avoid exporting unneeded symbols and refactored a bit of code.
    
    * Some more refactoring.
    
    * Simplified and added more comments.
    
    * Some more comments and simplification. Added a missing license block.

    c# feature(RepeatedField): Capacity property to resize the internal array
    
    This property is useful for efficiently initializing long RepeatedFields.
    
    I used System.Collections.Generic.List's design as a model.  It should feel the most familiar to C# developers.

    Add proto3 to solidity link
    
    pb3-gen-sol is a proto3 to solidity library generator that supports proto3 native types and uses field option for solidity native types. Both the message and generated code are more efficient than other solutions. It also includes a library to decode protobuf wireformat.

    Support ToString in RepeatedField and MapField.
    
    This changes how we approach JSON formatting in general - instead of looking  at the field a value came from, we just look at the type of the value. It's possible this *could* be slightly inefficient, but if we start caring about JSON performance deeply, we'll probably want to rewrite all of this anyway. It's definitely simpler this way.
    
    When we support dynamic messages, we'll need to modify JsonFormatter to handle enum values, as they won't come be "real" .NET enums at that point. It shouldn't be hard to do though.

    Push out changes from internal codebase.
    
    All Languages
    * Repeated fields of primitive types (types other that string, group, and
      nested messages) may now use the option [packed = true] to get a more
      efficient encoding.  In the new encoding, the entire list is written
      as a single byte blob using the "length-delimited" wire type.  Within
      this blob, the individual values are encoded the same way they would
      be normally except without a tag before each value (thus, they are
      tightly "packed").
    
    C++
    * UnknownFieldSet now supports STL-like iteration.
    * Message interface has method ParseFromBoundedZeroCopyStream() which parses
      a limited number of bytes from an input stream rather than parsing until
      EOF.
    
    Java
    * Fixed bug where Message.mergeFrom(Message) failed to merge extensions.
    * Message interface has new method toBuilder() which is equivalent to
      newBuilderForType().mergeFrom(this).
    * All enums now implement the ProtocolMessageEnum interface.
    * Setting a field to null now throws NullPointerException.
    * Fixed tendency for TextFormat's parsing to overflow the stack when
      parsing large string values.  The underlying problem is with Java's
      regex implementation (which unfortunately uses recursive backtracking
      rather than building an NFA).  Worked around by making use of possesive
      quantifiers.
    
    Python
    * Updated RPC interfaces to allow for blocking operation.  A client may
      now pass None for a callback when making an RPC, in which case the
      call will block until the response is received, and the response
      object will be returned directly to the caller.  This interface change
      cannot be used in practice until RPC implementations are updated to
      implement it.

    Integrate changes from internal code.
    
    protoc
    * Enum values may now have custom options, using syntax similar to field
      options.
    * Fixed bug where .proto files which use custom options but don't actually
      define them (i.e. they import another .proto file defining the options)
      had to explicitly import descriptor.proto.
    * Adjacent string literals in .proto files will now be concatenated, like in
      C.
    
    C++
    * Generated message classes now have a Swap() method which efficiently swaps
      the contents of two objects.
    * All message classes now have a SpaceUsed() method which returns an estimate
      of the number of bytes of allocated memory currently owned by the object.
      This is particularly useful when you are reusing a single message object
      to improve performance but want to make sure it doesn't bloat up too large.
    * New method Message::SerializeAsString() returns a string containing the
      serialized data.  May be more convenient than calling
      SerializeToString(string*).
    * In debug mode, log error messages when string-type fields are found to
      contain bytes that are not valid UTF-8.
    * Fixed bug where a message with multiple extension ranges couldn't parse
      extensions.
    * Fixed bug where MergeFrom(const Message&) didn't do anything if invoked on
      a message that contained no fields (but possibly contained extensions).
    * Fixed ShortDebugString() to not be O(n^2).  Durr.
    * Fixed crash in TextFormat parsing if the first token in the input caused a
      tokenization error.
    
    Java
    * New overload of mergeFrom() which parses a slice of a byte array instead
      of the whole thing.
    * New method ByteString.asReadOnlyByteBuffer() does what it sounds like.
    * Improved performance of isInitialized() when optimizing for code size.
    
    Python
    * Corrected ListFields() signature in Message base class to match what
      subclasses actually implement.
    * Some minor refactoring.
