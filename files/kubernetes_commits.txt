    Merge pull request #83747 from JohnStrunk/csi-fsgroup-fix
    
    Improve efficiency of csiMountMgr.GetAttributes

commit 55881f2fc4b8dacdba32a317d92e4ca1f1013512
Author: John Strunk <jstrunk@redhat.com>

    Improve efficiency of csiMountMgr.GetAttributes
    
    GetAttributes is called repeatedly while setting the fsGroup of a
    volume. Previously, it recalculated whether SELinux was supported during
    each call. This resulted in volume.SetVolumeOwnership taking a long
    time, delaying pod startup for high file count volumes.
    
    This change checks the SELinux status once, right after node publish,
    allowing GetAttributes to simply build and return a struct.

    gonum: directed acyclic graph
    
    Implements graph.Directed capable of storing at most one edge between any two nodes.
    Uses the Undirected implementation for space efficiency (~30% space savings).

    Merge pull request #35227 from deads2k/controller-13-generic-infromer
    
    Automatic merge from submit-queue
    
    add generic shared informer backed by existing informer
    
    Adds the ability to get an informer and lister that returns `[]runtime.Object` methods with the "normal" filtering capabilities based on a `GroupResource`. Right now, it only works on known types (and re-uses those caches for efficiency by having a different skin on the `Index`).  It should be extended in the future.
    
    @derekwaynecarr I think this gives you the types you were looking for to avoid the ugly array copies.

    Merge pull request #32805 from caesarxuchao/more-gc-optimization
    
    Automatic merge from submit-queue
    
    Add the uid in a delete event to the absentOwnerCache
    
    This is a small optimization to further reduce the traffic sent by the GC.
    
    In #31167, GC caches the non-existent owners when it processes the dirtyQueue. As discovered in #32571, there is still small inefficiency, because there are multiple goroutines processing the dirtyQueue, many of them might send a GET to the apiserver before the cache gets populated.
    
    This PR populates the cache when GC observes an object gets deleted, which happens before the processing of the dirtyQueue, so it avoids the simultaneous GET sent by the GC workers.
