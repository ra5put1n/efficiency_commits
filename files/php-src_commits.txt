    Fix #79247: Garbage collecting variant objects segfaults
    
    variant objects have no (declared) properties, so the `get_properties`
    handlers returns a pointer to constant storage for efficiency reasons.
    This pointer must not be returned from the `get_gc` handler, though;
    instead we set up an own `get_gc` handler and return NULL from it, to
    signal that there are no properties to collect.

    Optimize strtr w/ 2nd arg array
    
    Fixes bug #63893: poor efficiency of strtr() using array with keys of
    very different length.
    
    The implementation is basically all new, which carries some risk with
    it.
    
    The algorithm is described in "A Fast Algorithm For Multi-Pattern
    Searching" (1994) by Sun Wu and Udi Manber.

    Fix 2 broken json tests.
    
    json_decode() returns a binary string, not unicode for
    efficiency, and if you are going to test invalid utf8
    in a test, you have to stuff it into a binary string
    or it will be valid unicode by definition.

    Added:
    
    proto bool PDOStatement::closeCursor()
    Closes the cursor, leaving the statement ready for re-execution.
    
    The purpose of the function is to free up the connection to the server so that
    other queries may be issued, but leaving the statement in a state that it can
    be re-executed.
    
    This is implemented either as an optional driver specific method (allowing for
    maximum efficiency), or as the generic PDO fallback if no driver specific
    function is installed.
    
    The PDO generic fallback is semantically the same as writing the following code
    in your PHP script:
    
    do {
            while ($stmt->fetch())
                    ;
            if (!$stmt->nextRowset())
                    break;
    } while (true);
