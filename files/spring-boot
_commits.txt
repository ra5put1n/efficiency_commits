    Optimize UrlPathHelper configuration for Spring MVC
    
    Prior to this commit, Spring Boot would auto-configure Spring MVC and
    would keep the default `UrlPathHelper` configuration.
    Since Spring Boot is in charge of configuring the `DispatcherServlet`
    and its mapping, it is in a position to optimally configure the
    `UrlPathHelper` depending on the chosen mapping.
    
    This commit sets the `alwaysUseFullPath` property of `UrlPathHelper` if
    the Servlet mapping is `"/"`. This is more efficient since this
    configuration requires less processing of the request path.
    
    Closes gh-21499

    Configure PathPattern for RSocket routing
    
    This commit configures a `PathPatternRouteMatcher` in the RSocket
    support if spring-web is on the classpath. This `RouteMatcher`
    implementation is more efficient than the `SimpleRouteMatcher`, which is
    based on the `AntPathMatcher`.

    More use entrySet() rather than using keySet() and get(key)
    
    This commit replaces some more occurrances of keySet() and get(key)
    with more efficient usage of the map's entry set.

    Add counter and gauge services based on in-memory buffers
    
    This seems pretty efficient (approx 12M write/s as opposed to 2M with
    the DefaultCounterService). N.B. there is no need to change most of
    the rest of the metrics stuff because metrics are write-often, read-
    seldom, so we don't need high performance reads as much.
    
    The Spring Integration configuration and Dropwizard support has changed
    a bit. Functionally very similar and probably opaque to users, but now
    the messaging operates as an Exporter on a @Scheduled method, and
    Dropwizard is a replacement [Gauge,Counter]Service.
    
    Metrics are all
    collected live in-memory (and can be very fast with Java 8), buffered
    there and shipped out to a MessageChannel (if one exists with id
    "metricsChannel") in a background thread.
    
    We can still use Java 8 library APIs (like LongAdder) but to compile
    to java 7 compatible byte code we have to forgo the use of lambdas :-(
    and shorthand generics (<>).
    
    Fixes gh-2682, fixes gh-2513 (for Java 8 and Dropwizard users).

    Rework Jetty startup so connectors are only started once
    
    Previously the server was started to make the ServletContext
    available, then, to prevent requests from being handled before the
    application context had been started, the connectors were stopped.
    Once application context startup had completed, the connectors were
    then started again. In addition to being somewhat inefficient, this
    caused problems on FreeBSD where stopping the connector didn't free
    up the port quickly enough for the subsequent start to then be able
    to bind to it.
    
    This commit updates the Jetty startup logic to be closer to the logic
    that's used for Tomcat. Before the server is started, the configured
    connectors are cached and then removed. The server is then started
    without any connectors. Once application context startup has
    completed, the connectors are reinstated and started.
    
    Fixes #968

    Change default BootstrapMode for JPA repositories
    
    Change the default `BootstrapMode` for auto-configured `JpaRepositories`
    to `BootstrapMode.DEFERRED` to allow the initialization of
    `EntityManagerFactory` to be parallelized for increased startup efficiency.
    
    Prior to this change, the default BootstrapMode for all auto-configured
    Spring Data repositories was `BootstrapMode.DEFAULT`.

    Configure Reactor HTTP client resources
    
    This commit adds support for the new `ReactorResourceFactory` and
    ensures that such a bean is created and destroyed with the application
    context. This will create a `ClientHttpConnector` bean, to be configured
    on the `WebClient.Builder` instance - or let developers create their own
    `ClientHttpConnector` bean to override that opinion.
    
    By default, the `ReactorResourceFactory` is configured to participate
    with the global resources, for better efficiency.
    
    Closes gh-14058
