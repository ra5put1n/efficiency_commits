    Modules: Add remaining list API functions (#8439)
    
    List functions operating on elements by index:
    
    * RM_ListGet
    * RM_ListSet
    * RM_ListInsert
    * RM_ListDelete
    
    Iteration is done using a simple for loop over indices.
    The index based functions use an internal iterator as an optimization.
    This is explained in the docs:
    
    ```
     * Many of the list functions access elements by index. Since a list is in
     * essence a doubly-linked list, accessing elements by index is generally an
     * O(N) operation. However, if elements are accessed sequentially or with
     * indices close together, the functions are optimized to seek the index from
     * the previous index, rather than seeking from the ends of the list.
     *
     * This enables iteration to be done efficiently using a simple for loop:
     *
     *     long n = RM_ValueLength(key);
     *     for (long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
     *         RedisModuleString *elem = RedisModule_ListGet(key, i);
     *         // Do stuff...
     *     }
    ```

    Extend freeSlotsToKeysMapAsync and freeTrackingRadixTreeAsync to check LAZYFREE_THRESHOLD. (#8969)
    
    Without this fix, FLUSHALL ASYNC would have freed these in a background thread,
    even if they didn't contain many elements (unlike how it works with other structures), which could be inefficient.

    Optimize HRANDFIELD and ZRANDMEMBER case 4 when ziplist encoded (#8444)
    
    It is inefficient to repeatedly pick a single random element from a
    ziplist.
    For CASE4, which is when the user requested a low number of unique
    random picks from the collectoin, we used thta pattern.
    
    Now we use a different algorithm that picks unique elements from a
    ziplist, and guarentee no duplicate but doesn't provide random order
    (which is only needed in the non-unique random picks case)
    
    Unrelated changes:
    * change ziplist count and indexes variables to unsigned
    * solve compilation warnings about uninitialized vars in gcc 10.2

    Add HRANDFIELD and ZRANDMEMBER. improvements to SRANDMEMBER (#8297)
    
    New commands:
    `HRANDFIELD [<count> [WITHVALUES]]`
    `ZRANDMEMBER [<count> [WITHSCORES]]`
    Algorithms are similar to the one in SRANDMEMBER.
    
    Both return a simple bulk response when no arguments are given, and an array otherwise.
    In case values/scores are requested, RESP2 returns a long array, and RESP3 a nested array.
    note: in all 3 commands, the only option that also provides random order is the one with negative count.
    
    Changes to SRANDMEMBER
    * Optimization when count is 1, we can use the more efficient algorithm of non-unique random
    * optimization: work with sds strings rather than robj
    
    Other changes:
    * zzlGetScore: when zset needs to convert string to double, we use safer memcpy (in
      case the buffer is too small)
    * Solve a "bug" in SRANDMEMBER test: it intended to test a positive count (case 3 or
      case 4) and by accident used a negative count

    Implement redisAtomic to replace _Atomic C11 builtin (#7707)
    
    Redis 6.0 introduces I/O threads, it is so cool and efficient, we use C11
    _Atomic to establish inter-thread synchronization without mutex. But the
    compiler that must supports C11 _Atomic can compile redis code, that brings a
    lot of inconvenience since some common platforms can't support by default such
    as CentOS7, so we want to implement redis atomic type to make it more portable.
    
    We have implemented our atomic variable for redis that only has 'relaxed'
    operations in src/atomicvar.h, so we implement some operations with
    'sequentially-consistent', just like the default behavior of C11 _Atomic that
    can establish inter-thread synchronization. And we replace all uses of C11
    _Atomic with redis atomic variable.
    
    Our implementation of redis atomic variable uses C11 _Atomic, __atomic or
    __sync macros if available, it supports most common platforms, and we will
    detect automatically which feature we use. In Makefile we use a dummy file to
    detect if the compiler supports C11 _Atomic. Now for gcc, we can compile redis
    code theoretically if your gcc version is not less than 4.1.2(starts to support
    __sync_xxx operations). Otherwise, we remove use mutex fallback to implement
    redis atomic variable for performance and test. You will get compiling errors
    if your compiler doesn't support all features of above.
    
    For cover redis atomic variable tests, we add other CI jobs that build redis on
    CentOS6 and CentOS7 and workflow daily jobs that run the tests on them.
    For them, we just install gcc by default in order to cover different compiler
    versions, gcc is 4.4.7 by default installation on CentOS6 and 4.8.5 on CentOS7.
    
    We restore the feature that we can test redis with Helgrind to find data race
    errors. But you need install Valgrind in the default path configuration firstly
    before running your tests, since we use macros in helgrind.h to tell Helgrind
    inter-thread happens-before relationship explicitly for avoiding false positives.
    Please open an issue on github if you find data race errors relate to this commit.
    
    Unrelated:
    - Fix redefinition of typedef 'RedisModuleUserChangedFunc'
      For some old version compilers, they will report errors or warnings, if we
      re-define function type.

    Implement SMISMEMBER key member [member ...] (#7615)
    
    This is a rebased version of #3078 originally by shaharmor
    with the following patches by TysonAndre made after rebasing
    to work with the updated C API:
    
    1. Add 2 more unit tests
       (wrong argument count error message, integer over 64 bits)
    2. Use addReplyArrayLen instead of addReplyMultiBulkLen.
    3. Undo changes to src/help.h - for the ZMSCORE PR,
       I heard those should instead be automatically
       generated from the redis-doc repo if it gets updated
    
    Motivations:
    
    - Example use case: Client code to efficiently check if each element of a set
      of 1000 items is a member of a set of 10 million items.
      (Similar to reasons for working on #7593)
    - HMGET and ZMSCORE already exist. This may lead to developers deciding
      to implement functionality that's best suited to a regular set with a
      data type of sorted set or hash map instead, for the multi-get support.
    
    Currently, multi commands or lua scripting to call sismember multiple times
    would almost definitely be less efficient than a native smismember
    for the following reasons:
    
    - Need to fetch the set from the string every time
      instead of reusing the C pointer.
    - Using pipelining or multi-commands would result in more bytes sent
      and received by the client for the repeated SISMEMBER KEY sections.
    - Need to specially encode the data and decode it from the client
      for lua-based solutions.
    - Proposed solutions using Lua or SADD/SDIFF could trigger writes to
      memory, which is undesirable on a redis replica server
      or when commands get replicated to replicas.

    Add a ZMSCORE command returning an array of scores. (#7593)
    
    Syntax: `ZMSCORE KEY MEMBER [MEMBER ...]`
    
    This is an extension of #2359
    amended by Tyson Andre to work with the changed unstable API,
    add more tests, and consistently return an array.
    
    - It seemed as if it would be more likely to get reviewed
      after updating the implementation.
    
    Currently, multi commands or lua scripting to call zscore multiple times
    would almost definitely be less efficient than a native ZMSCORE
    for the following reasons:
    
    - Need to fetch the set from the string every time instead of reusing the C
      pointer.
    - Using pipelining or multi-commands would result in more bytes sent by
      the client for the repeated `ZMSCORE KEY` sections.
    - Need to specially encode the data and decode it from the client
      for lua-based solutions.
    - The fastest solution I've seen for large sets(thousands or millions)
      involves lua and a variadic ZADD, then a ZINTERSECT, then a ZRANGE 0 -1,
      then UNLINK of a temporary set (or lua). This is still inefficient.

    RM_Scan disable dict rehashing
    
    The callback approach we took is very efficient, the module can do any
    filtering of keys without building any list and cloning strings, it can
    also read data from the key's value. but if the user tries to re-open
    the key, or any other key, this can cause dict re-hashing (dictFind does
    that), and that's very bad to do from inside dictScan.
    
    this commit protects the dict from doing any rehashing during scan, but
    also warns the user not to attempt any writes or command calls from
    within the callback, for fear of unexpected side effects and crashes.

    slave buffers were wasteful and incorrectly counted causing eviction
    
    A) slave buffers didn't count internal fragmentation and sds unused space,
       this caused them to induce eviction although we didn't mean for it.
    
    B) slave buffers were consuming about twice the memory of what they actually needed.
    - this was mainly due to sdsMakeRoomFor growing to twice as much as needed each time
      but networking.c not storing more than 16k (partially fixed recently in 237a38737).
    - besides it wasn't able to store half of the new string into one buffer and the
      other half into the next (so the above mentioned fix helped mainly for small items).
    - lastly, the sds buffers had up to 30% internal fragmentation that was wasted,
      consumed but not used.
    
    C) inefficient performance due to starting from a small string and reallocing many times.
    
    what i changed:
    - creating dedicated buffers for reply list, counting their size with zmalloc_size
    - when creating a new reply node from, preallocate it to at least 16k.
    - when appending a new reply to the buffer, first fill all the unused space of the
      previous node before starting a new one.
    
    other changes:
    - expose mem_not_counted_for_evict info field for the benefit of the test suite
    - add a test to make sure slave buffers are counted correctly and that they don't cause eviction

    ae.c: introduce the concept of read->write barrier.
    
    AOF fsync=always, and certain Redis Cluster bus operations, require to
    fsync data on disk before replying with an acknowledge.
    In such case, in order to implement Group Commits, we want to be sure
    that queries that are read in a given cycle of the event loop, are never
    served to clients in the same event loop iteration. This way, by using
    the event loop "before sleep" callback, we can fsync the information
    just one time before returning into the event loop for the next cycle.
    This is much more efficient compared to calling fsync() multiple times.
    
    Unfortunately because of a bug, this was not always guaranteed: the
    actual way the events are installed was the sole thing that could
    control. Normally this problem is hard to trigger when AOF is enabled
    with fsync=always, because we try to flush the output buffers to the
    socekt directly in the beforeSleep() function of Redis. However if the
    output buffers are full, we actually install a write event, and in such
    a case, this bug could happen.
    
    This change to ae.c modifies the event loop implementation to make this
    concept explicit. Write events that are registered with:
    
        AE_WRITABLE|AE_BARRIER
    
    Are guaranteed to never fire after the readable event was fired for the
    same file descriptor. In this way we are sure that data is persisted to
    disk before the client performing the operation receives an
    acknowledged.
    
    However note that this semantics does not provide all the guarantees
    that one may believe are automatically provided. Take the example of the
    blocking list operations in Redis.
    
    With AOF and fsync=always we could have:
    
        Client A doing: BLPOP myqueue 0
        Client B doing: RPUSH myqueue a b c
    
    In this scenario, Client A will get the "a" elements immediately after
    the Client B RPUSH will be executed, even before the operation is persisted.
    However when Client B will get the acknowledge, it can be sure that
    "b,c" are already safe on disk inside the list.
    
    What to note here is that it cannot be assumed that Client A receiving
    the element is a guaranteed that the operation succeeded from the point
    of view of Client B.
    
    This is due to the fact that the barrier exists within the same socket,
    and not between different sockets. However in the case above, the
    element "a" was not going to be persisted regardless, so it is a pretty
    synthetic argument.

    Streams: XADD MAXLEN implementation.
    
    The core of this change is the implementation of stream trimming, and
    the resulting MAXLEN option of XADD as a trivial result of having
    trimming functionalities. MAXLEN already works but in order to be more
    efficient listpack GC should be implemented, currently marked as a TODO
    item inside the comments.

    Streams: delta encode IDs based on key. Add count + deleted fields.
    
    We used to have the master ID stored at the start of the listpack,
    however using the key directly makes more sense in order to create a
    space efficient representation: anyway the key at the radix tree is very
    unlikely to change because of how the stream is implemented. Moreover on
    nodes merging, to rewrite the merged listpacks is anyway the most
    sensible operation, and we can use the iterator and the append-to-stream
    function in order to avoid re-implementing the code needed for merging.
    
    This commit also adds two items at the start of the listpack: the
    number of valid items inside the listpack, and the number of items
    marked as deleted. This means that there is no need to scan a listpack
    in order to understand if it's a good candidate for garbage collection,
    if the ration between valid/deleted items triggers the GC.

    Streams: fix XREAD ready-key signaling.
    
    With lists we need to signal only on key creation, but streams can
    provide data to clients listening at every new item added.
    To make this slightly more efficient we now track different classes of
    blocked clients to avoid signaling keys when there is nobody listening.
    A typical case is when the stream is used as a time series DB and
    accessed only by range with XRANGE.

    Fix quicklistReplaceAtIndex() by updating the quicklist ziplist size.
    
    The quicklist takes a cached version of the ziplist representation size
    in bytes. The implementation must update this length every time the
    underlying ziplist changes. However quicklistReplaceAtIndex() failed to
    fix the length.
    
    During LSET calls, the size of the ziplist blob and the cached size
    inside the quicklist diverged. Later, when this size is used in an
    authoritative way, for example during nodes splitting in order to copy
    the nodes, we end with a duplicated node that may contain random
    garbage.
    
    This commit should fix issue #3343, however several problems were found
    reviewing the quicklist.c code in search of this bug that should be
    addressed soon or later.
    
    For example:
    
    1. To take a cached ziplist length is fragile since failing to update it
    leads to this kind of issues.
    
    2. The node splitting code needs auditing. For example it works just for
    a side effect of ziplistDeleteRange() to be able to cope with a wrong
    count of elements to remove. The code inside quicklist.c assumes that
    -1 means "delete till the end" while actually it's just a count of how
    many elements to delete, and is an unsigned count. So -1 gets converted
    into the maximum integer, and just by chance the ziplist code stops
    deleting elements after there are no more to delete.
    
    3. Node splitting is extremely inefficient, it copies the node and
    removes elements from both nodes even when actually there is to move a
    single entry from one node to the other, or when the new resulting node
    is empty at all so there is nothing to copy but just to create a new
    node.
    
    However at least for Redis 3.2 to introduce fresh code inside
    quicklist.c may be even more risky, so instead I'm writing a better
    fuzzy tester to stress the internals a bit more in order to anticipate
    other possible bugs.
    
    This bug was found using a fuzzy tester written after having some clue
    about where the bug could be. The tester eventually created a ~2000
    commands sequence able to always crash Redis. I wrote a better version
    of the tester that searched for the smallest sequence that could crash
    Redis automatically. Later this smaller sequence was minimized by
    removing random commands till it still crashed the server. This resulted
    into a sequence of 7 commands. With this small sequence it was just a
    matter of filling the code with enough printf() to understand enough
    state to fix the bug.

    Diskless replication: rio fdset target new supports buffering.
    
    To perform a socket write() for each RDB rio API write call was
    extremely unefficient, so now rio has minimal buffering capabilities.
    Writes are accumulated into a buffer and only when a given limit is
    reacehd are actually wrote to the N slaves FDs.
    
    Trivia: rio lacked support for buffering since our targets were:
    
    1) Memory buffers.
    2) C standard I/O.
    
    Both were buffered already.

    Allow atomic memory count update with C11 builtins
    
    From mailing list post https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/redis-db/QLjiQe4D7LA
    
    In zmalloc.c the following primitives are currently used
    to synchronize access to single global variable:
    __sync_add_and_fetch
    __sync_sub_and_fetch
    
    In some architectures such as powerpc these primitives are overhead
    intensive. More efficient C11 __atomic builtins are available with
    newer GCC versions, see
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.2/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html#_005f_005fatomic-Builtins
    
    By substituting the following  __atomic… builtins:
    __atomic_add_fetch
    __atomic_sub_fetch
    
    the performance improvement on certain architectures such as powerpc can be significant,
    around 10% to 15%, over the implementation using __sync builtins while there is only slight uptick on
    Intel architectures because it was already enforcing Intel Strongly ordered memory semantics.
    
    The selection of __atomic built-ins can be predicated on the definition of ATOMIC_RELAXED
    which Is available on in gcc 4.8.2 and later versions.

    New commands: BITOP and BITCOUNT.
    
    The motivation for this new commands is to be search in the usage of
    Redis for real time statistics. See the article "Fast real time metrics
    using Redis".
    
    http://blog.getspool.com/2011/11/29/fast-easy-realtime-metrics-using-redis-bitmaps/
    
    In general Redis strings when used as bitmaps using the SETBIT/GETBIT
    command provide a very space-efficient and fast way to store statistics.
    For instance in a web application with users, every user can be
    associated with a key that shows every day in which the user visited the
    web service. This information can be really valuable to extract user
    behaviour information.
    
    With Redis bitmaps doing this is very simple just saying that a given
    day is 0 (the data the service was put online) and all the next days are
    1, 2, 3, and so forth. So with SETBIT it is possible to set the bit
    corresponding to the current day every time the user visits the site.
    
    It is possible to take the count of the bit sets on the run, this is
    extremely easy using a Lua script. However a fast bit count native
    operation can be useful, especially if it can operate on ranges, or when
    the string is small like in the case of days (even if you consider many
    years it is still extremely little data).
    
    For this reason BITOP was introduced. The command counts the number of
    bits set to 1 in a string, with optional range:
    
    BITCOUNT key [start end]
    
    The start/end parameters are similar to GETRANGE. If omitted the whole
    string is tested.
    
    Population counting is more useful when bit-level operations like AND,
    OR and XOR are avaialble. For instance I can test multiple users to see
    the number of days three users visited the site at the same time. To do
    this we can take the AND of all the bitmaps, and then count the set bits.
    
    For this reason the BITOP command was introduced:
    
    BITOP [AND|OR|XOR|NOT] dest_key src_key1 src_key2 src_key3 ... src_keyN
    
    In the special case of NOT (that inverts the bits) only one source key
    can be passed.
    
    The judicious use of BITCOUNT and BITOP combined can lead to interesting
    use cases with very space efficient representation of data.
    
    The implementation provided is still not tested and optimized for speed,
    next commits will introduce unit tests. Later the implementation will be
    profiled to see if it is possible to gain an important amount of speed
    without making the code much more complex.

    fix: lookupKey on SETNX and SETXX only once (#9640)
    
    When using SETNX and SETXX we could end up doing key lookup twice.
    This presents a small inefficiency price.
    Also once we have statistics of write hit and miss they'll be wrong (recording the same key hit twice)

    Mem efficiency, make full use of client struct memory for reply buffers (#8968)
    
    When we allocate a client struct with 16k reply buffer, the allocator we may give us 20K,
    This commit makes use of that extra space.
    Additionally, it tries to store whatever it can from the reply into the static 'buf' before
    allocating a new node for the reply list.

    Fix timing of new replication test (#8807)
    
    In github actions CI with valgrind, i saw that even the fast replica
    (one that wasn't paused), didn't get to complete the replication fast
    enough, and ended up getting disconnected by timeout.
    
    Additionally, due to a typo in uname, we didn't get to actually run the
    CPU efficiency part of the test.

    More efficient self-XCLAIM (#8098)
    
    when the same consumer re-claim an entry that it already has, there's
    no need to remove-and-insert if it's the same rax.
    we do need to update the idle time though.
    this commit only improves efficiency (doesn't change behavior).

    Allow '\0' inside of result of sdscatvprintf, and efficiency improvements (#6260)
    
    This will allow to use: RedisModule_CreateStringPrintf(ctx, "%s %c %s", "string1", 0, "string2");
    
    On large string, the previous code would incrementally retry to double the output buffer.
    now it uses the the return value of snprintf and grows to the right size in one step.
    
    and also avoids an excessive strlen in sdscat at the end.

    Jemalloc: use LG_QUANTUM of 3 for AMD64 and I386.
    
    This gives us a 24 bytes size class which is dict.c dictEntry size, thus
    improving the memory efficiency of Redis significantly.
    Moreover other non 16 bytes aligned tiny classes are added that further
    reduce the fragmentation of the allocator.
    
    Technically speaking LG_QUANTUM should be 4 on i386 / AMD64 because of
    SSE types and other 16 bytes types, however we don't use those, and our
    jemalloc only targets Redis.
    
    New versions of Jemalloc will have an explicit configure switch in order
    to specify the quantum value for a platform without requiring any change
    to the Jemalloc source code: we'll switch to this system when available.
    
    This change was originally proposed by Oran Agra (@oranagra) as a change
    to the Jemalloc script to generate the size classes define. We ended
    doing it differently by changing LG_QUANTUM since it is apparently the
    supported Jemalloc method to obtain a 24 bytes size class, moreover it
    also provides us other potentially useful size classes.
    
    Related to issue #2510.

    Faster memory efficiency test.
    
    This test on Linux was extremely slow, since in Tcl we can't enable
    easily tcp-nodelay, so the busy loop used to take *a lot* with bigger
    writes. Fixed using pipelining.

    Mark PFCOUNT as read-only, even if not true.
    
    PFCOUNT is technically speaking a write command, since the cached value
    of the HLL is exposed in the data structure (design error, mea culpa), and
    can be modified by PFCOUNT.
    
    However if we flag PFCOUNT as "w", read only slaves can't execute the
    command, which is a problem since there are environments where slaves
    are used to scale PFCOUNT reads.
    
    Nor it is possible to just prevent PFCOUNT to modify the data structure
    in slaves, since without the cache we lose too much efficiency.
    
    So while this commit allows slaves to create a temporary inconsistency
    (the strings representing the HLLs in the master and slave can be
    different in certain moments) it is actually harmless.
    
    In the long run this should be probably fixed by turning the HLL into a
    more opaque representation, for example by storing the cached value in
    the part of the string which is not exposed (this should be possible
    with SDS strings).

    serverCron() frequency is now a runtime parameter (was REDIS_HZ).
    
    REDIS_HZ is the frequency our serverCron() function is called with.
    A more frequent call to this function results into less latency when the
    server is trying to handle very expansive background operations like
    mass expires of a lot of keys at the same time.
    
    Redis 2.4 used to have an HZ of 10. This was good enough with almost
    every setup, but the incremental key expiration algorithm was working a
    bit better under *extreme* pressure when HZ was set to 100 for Redis
    2.6.
    
    However for most users a latency spike of 30 milliseconds when million
    of keys are expiring at the same time is acceptable, on the other hand a
    default HZ of 100 in Redis 2.6 was causing idle instances to use some
    CPU time compared to Redis 2.4. The CPU usage was in the order of 0.3%
    for an idle instance, however this is a shame as more energy is consumed
    by the server, if not important resources.
    
    This commit introduces HZ as a runtime parameter, that can be queried by
    INFO or CONFIG GET, and can be modified with CONFIG SET. At the same
    time the default frequency is set back to 10.
    
    In this way we default to a sane value of 10, but allows users to
    easily switch to values up to 500 for near real-time applications if
    needed and if they are willing to pay this small CPU usage penalty.
